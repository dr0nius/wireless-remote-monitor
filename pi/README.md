# Blueprint #3 - Remote Monitor - Backend App
### Set up the Raspberry Pi Zero Remote Monitor Script

You can, technically, do this next step from the Raspberry Pi Zero if you have an internet connection. The 3G modem will work wonders here, if already assembled.

1. Download the python script from the repository **[remote_monitor.py.](https://github.com/Deeplocal/blueprints/blob/master/remote-monitor/pi/remote_monitor.py)** (An alternative is to download the script to a USB Flash Drive and transfer it to the Pi.)
3. Then, **copy our python script** (remote_monitor.py) onto the Pi. We added it to the Documents directory /home/pi/Documents/.
4. To run this file, you will need to install the packages picamera and socketIO client, which can be done with PIP. From the terminal’s command line, **type these two commands:**

        pip intall picamera
        pip install socketIO_client

5. The script also needs a place to save the photos it takes. Create one by adding a directory in the same place you copied the remote_monitor.py script.

        mkdir /home/pi/Documents/images

6. Ensure that the path where you added your images folder matches the path on line 13
7. Update the server info in the remote_monitor.py file
  - Change the server_url variable on line 14 to the URL where your server is running
  - Change the server_port variable on line 15 to the port the server is on (if using localtunnel this will be 80).
8. Update the camera info in the remote_monitor.py file with the values from the server setup step.
  - Change the camera_name variable on line 16 to the name you used when adding the camera
  - Change the camera_token variable on line 17 to the value generated by the server
  - Change the camera_id variable on line 18 to the value generated by the server
9. To run our script, you just need to **run this command from the command line**:

      python /home/pi/Documents/remote_monitor.py

### Configure the Pi to run the script at start-up. (optional)

You can manually run the script every time you want to use the camera, so we are going to configure the Raspberry Pi Zero to run the script at start-up.

To do this, we need to add a line to the file **rc.local** on the Pi, which runs on startup, located in /etc/rc.local.

* From the command line, **type this to edit rc.local:**

      sudo nano /etc/rc.local

Add this line right before it reads ‘exit 0’:

    python /home/pi/Documents/remote_monitor.py

rc.local will look like the following:

    #!/bin/sh -e
    #
    # rc.local
    #
    # This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
    # Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
    # value on error.
    #
    # In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
    # bits.
    #
    # By default this script does nothing.
    # Print the IP address
    _IP=$(hostname -I) || true
    if [ "$_IP" ]; then
    printf "My IP address is %s\n" "$_IP"
    fi
    python /home/pi/Documents/remote_monitor.py
    exit 0

* **Save and exit the file editor**.
* The script is set up and should run on start-up and can be run directly via the command line.
